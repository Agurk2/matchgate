# Matchgate Game
A prediction game based upon the results from matchgate benchmarking as defined by [this paper](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2022-02-21-657/pdf/)

## Who are we?
This game was developed by a high school student interested in quantum computing. I have around 2.5 years of experience in the quantum field and I hope to someday pursue it professionally.

## Project
This game focuses on developing the users quantum prediction skills just from a circuit. This circuit was developed using the matchgate group, which is useful in scalable benchmarking.  

The game is text-based, so please run the notebook and follow the last 2 cells instructions. Additionally, a partial implementation of matchgate benchmarking is included, though not implemented fully
